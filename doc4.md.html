<p>This assignment askes you to build a program that reads a <strong>Markdown</strong> file and converts it to a HTML file.You are given a documentation [link][1] on the Markdown syntax which starts as follows: </p>
<p>Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishableas-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. WhileMarkdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters – including Setext, atx,Textile, reStructuredText, Grutatext, and EtText – the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’ssyntax is the format of plain text email.</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 2em; border-bottom: 1px solid silver; paddding-bottom: 5px;">Code Blocks </h2>
<p>Pre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about programming or markup source code. Rather than forming normal paragraphs, the lines of a code block are interpreted literally. Markdown wraps a code block in both &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;code&gt; tags. For example: </p>
<p><pre><code> if (x > y)   return x ; else   return y ; </code></pre> </p>
